        <h1>Rough Draft In Progress</h1>
        <h1 class='articleTitle'>The War in Heaven Continues Today</h1>
        <p>One of the reasons I decided to start writing these articles is because I’ve noticed that many people tend to disassociate politics and religion, confining them to separate spheres in their minds. But I would suggest that they are simply two different battle fields of the same war, the war that began in heaven.</p>
        
        <br><h2>The Agency/Security Tradeoff</h2>
        <p>In the beginning, there was a war. Heavenly Father’s plan was to send us to earth with the gift of agency, the ability to choose to become like Him. Desiring glory and power over others, Satan had a different plan in mind. He claimed  that we could all make it back safely if only our agency were removed from the equation. In exchange for our agency, he guaranteed security. Even though his plan was rejected, he continues to trick people into giving away their agency by promising security. Throughout our lives, we’ll be faced with many opportunities to give up our agency in exchange for a sense of security and vice versa.</p>

            <p>There are two contending forces. Those forces are known and have been designated by different terms throughout the ages. In the beginning they were known as Satan on the one hand, and Christ on the other… In these days, they are called domination by the state, on one hand, personal liberty, on the other.
                <br><br>
                -President David O. McKay, <a href='https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-o-mckay/two-contending-forces/'>Two Contending Forces</a>, May 18, 1960

        <h2>Examples in Our World Today</h2>
        <p>The agency/security tradeoff is everywhere in our lives, and some are even good tradeoffs. Here are a few examples:</p>
        <p>- Seatbelts -  give up the agency to move freely in exchange for being safer in case of a crash</p>
        <p>- College - give up the agency of what to do with that time and money in exchange for the security that you’ll receive a job</p>
        <p>- Social Security - give up the agency of what to do with your money in exchange for the security of a steady income when you can no longer work</p>
        <p>- Right to Bear Arms - give up the ability to protect yourself in exchange for the security that no one will attack you with a gun</p>
        <p>- Safe Spaces - give up freedom of speech in exchange for the security that no one will get offended</p>
        <p>- Communism - give up the ability to make as much money as we work for in exchange for the security that everyone will be equal and things will be fair</p>
        <p>- Separation of Church and State – give up your agency to talk about God professional environments for the security that no one will get offended</p>
        <p>- Insurance – give up your agency of how to use your money in exchange for the security that if something bad happens to you, they’ll cover you</p>
        <p>- Taxes – Give up your agency of how to use your money in exchange for the security that it will be “used wisely”</p>
        <p>- Abortion - Give up the baby’s agency in exchange for the security of not having to care for a child</p>
        <p>- Racism – give up your agency to judge someone based on their character in exchange for the security that minorities won’t be discriminated</p>
        <p>Some of these tradeoffs are worthwhile and will actually make our lives better. Others will make it much worse. This is one of Satan’s tactics to make the good things seem bad and the bad things seem good. We need to analyze each issue and situation through this lens and ask ourselves, what freedoms am I giving up in exchange for what is being promised?</p>
        <p>The irony of the tradeoff is that often, the security that is guaranteed is actually not guaranteed. In fact, it is often an outright lie, a ploy that Satan uses in order to trick us into giving up our agency. Satan promised that we would all make it back to heaven if we gave up our agency. We know however, that we cannot become like God unless we choose to do so. Unless we use our agency to deliberately make more than a lifetime of choices that lead us in that direction, we will never become like our Heavenly Father or return to live with him. Satan’s guarantee was a lie. A promise that was never even possible to deliver on.</p>
    
        <br><h2>Antithesis</h2>
        <p>Many members of the church disagree with me. Some say that we can promote the gospel in the world without getting involved in politics, because politics are too contentious. Worse yet, some argue that these issues are not Satan’s ploys to restrict agency but are in fact Christ-like values.(see good will be evil and evil will be good, see is socialism Christ-like?) I would invite these members to remember that we are warriors in battle. Satan is fighting to restrict our own and others’ agency. We as members of the church are blessed with the big picture perspective, so we must defend the truth, and persuade our fellow men to come unto the Savior.</p>

            <p>How would you have reacted if during the War in Heaven someone had said to you, ‘Look, just do what’s right, there is no need to get involved in the fight for free agency.’ Now it is obvious what the devil is trying to do, but it is sad to see many of us fall for his destructive line.
                <br><br>The cause of freedom is the most basic part of our religion.
                <br><br>Our position on freedom helped get us to this earth, and it can make the difference as to whether we get back home or not.
